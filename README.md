# hot-disc
A simple python script to calculation the velocity dispersion of a (simulated) stellar disc that arises due to spurious 
collisional heating of its stellar particles by its dark matter halo particles. The stellar disc is assumed to be embedded 
within an spherically symmetric NFW halo with isotropic DM particle velocities. The number of DM particles within r200, N200, 
is determined by the halo mass and the assumed DM particle mass. The empirical model predicts how the scattering of stellar 
disc particles off DM particles increases their velocity dispersion in the (phi,z,R) directions over a time interval t. The 
model can be applied at any galacto-centric radius; below we choose r50, the typical half-stellar mass radius, and R=8 [kpc]. 

Details about the model (including validation tests) can be found in Ludlow et al (2021); Wilkinson et al (2023).             
For an application of the model to cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, see Ludlow et al (2023)
